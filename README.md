**Full Stack Developer Intern, Jivass Technologies** Jun 2021 - Jul 2021

- Worked on ReactJS for frontend and Django for backend, the user database was PostgreSQL Created React Web Application. Worked a codebase of around **1GB**.
- Project Included **Dummy** Data Creation, **Primary**** Dashboards **for** Customers **,** Supervisors**, and Super admin.
- Created Website till alpha phase, as per client demands

### Full Stack Developer Intern, Chillitray Technologies Mar 2021 - May 2021

- Worked on building **token** and **OTP-based** authentication systems with sessions.
- Implemented **HTTP authorization**
- Created API s for sending **SMS&#39;s, Emails** for verifications of accounts. Built different types of media and other types of **API&#39;s** as per needs

### Machine Learning Developer Intern, FTS (Failure to Success) May 2021 - Jul 2021

- During the Internship, two datasets were given to analyze. Both datasets had gases and particulate matter but one had hourly frequency and the other has a daily frequency
- Analyzed the day-wise data to get an algorithm that can calculate **AQI** from a gaseous composition
- Built an **LSTM** based time series prediction algorithm on **city-by-hour** data. Processed data with **1000000 rows** and 8 columns.

### Machine Learning Intern, Go Data Insights Jun 2021 - Aug 2021

- _ **Project GREEN SCORE** _ **:** Built a system with which one can calculate the greenery score of an area with **longitude, latitude** , and radius. Built algorithm for calculating the green score. Used open street map api to fetch the data for the algorithm. Calculated the greenery of an area accurately up to **1km** [Blog](https://www.godatainsights.com/post/track-delhi-sustainable-development-goal-greenest-area)
- _ **Project FIRE COUNT PREDICTION** _ **:** Analyzed NASA&#39;s fire data from the **MODIS satellite**. built a fire count prediction system for a region (a longitude, latitude bounding box). Worked with a dataset of around **4 million rows** [Blog](https://www.godatainsights.com/post/monitor-forest-fire-risk-for-insurance-purposes)
- _ **Project CRYPTO PRICE PREDICTION** _ **:** Built a stock price prediction system. But This is different from general stock price prediction systems because it also considers the effect of current news sentiment and shows its effect on prediction too. [Blog](https://www.godatainsights.com/post/fin-social-analysis-of-rising-cryptocurrencies)
- Created a robust **python package** for the projects which was directly inserted into the **company&#39;s backend**.

## PROJECTs (Self) ![](RackMultipart20210908-4-myktca_html_7456c3be86d537d1.gif)

### Text To Image Generator

- The aim is to convert a written text (like &quot;a blue flying bird&quot;) into an image. NLP is used to extract a feature vector from the text description.
- GANs are used to create images from a combination of **text embedding (1024)** and **random latent vector (100)**.

### Image Clustering with K means**

- The idea is to create an Image clustering model which can be used to create clusters from large dataset of images.
- If someone is limited by computing resources then this technique can be used for sampling images. so that models can be tested on samples.

### Radiation Sensor, Measurements and Instrumentation Course project

- The aim of this project was to study a radiation sensor and create a detailed analysis report on it.
- Studied about types of radiation sensor. Studied Geiger Muller Counter thoroughly and talked with its manufacturers.

### Project SBoard, Center for Innovation, IIT Madras

- The aim of this project is creating a touch keyboard in which one can switch from keys to mouse with a simple gesture.
- Learning R-pi and programming embedded systems
- Did research for haptic touch and Ultrasonic feedback. Now building software for the user interface and functionality. Due to COVID-19 we are not able to experiment things.

### Project FND

- The aim of this project is to classify news articles fake or real.
- To get the accurately classified collection of news as real or fake I have built a deep learning **LSTM based** model. After using many training techniques, I got a **validation accuracy** of **0.9387** with training accuracy of 0.9538%.

### Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network

- The aim of this project is to build model with which one can generate new images after training the model.
- During training model was found robust to result on addition of new images to training set.
