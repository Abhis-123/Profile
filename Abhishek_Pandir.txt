WORK EXPERIENCE
Machine Learning Researcher Intern, Go Data Insights						June 2021 - Aug 2021
* Project GREEN SCORE: Built a system with which one can calculate the greenery score of an area with longitude, latitude, and radius. Built algorithm for calculating the green score. Used open street map API to fetch the data for the algorithm. Calculated the greenery of an area accurately up to 1km.    Blog
* Project FIRE COUNT PREDICTION: Analyzed NASA’s fire data from the MODIS satellite. built a fire count prediction system for a region (a longitude, latitude bounding box). Worked with a dataset of around 4 million rows  Blog
* Project CRYPTO PRICE PREDICTION: Built a stock price prediction system. But This is different from general stock price prediction systems because it also considers the effect of current news sentiment and shows its effect on prediction too. Blog 
* Created a robust python package for the projects which was directly inserted into the company’s backend.  
Machine Learning Developer Intern, FTS (Failure to Success) 	 	 	 	 	  June 2021 - Jul 2021 
* Worked on daily and hourly air composition dataset consisting of 1000000 rows. Analyzed data and built a ML algorithm and calculated Air Quality Index from gaseous composition.
* Built an LSTM based time series prediction algorithm on city-by-hour data. 
Backend Developer Intern, Chillitray Technologies						 	     Feb 2021 - Apr 2021
* Worked on building token and OTP-based authentication systems with sessions. Implemented HTTP authorization
* Created API s for sending SMS’s, Emails for verifications of accounts. Built different types of media and other types of API’s as per needs
PROJECTs 
Reverse Image Search Engine, GoDataInsights, Currently Working  
* The aim of this project to create image + text base search engine for product recommendation.
* Implemented a VGG-16 feature vector-based image vs image comparison system which increase search speed by 10X.
* * Experimenting with different similarity matrices to improve results. 
Project FND, Self, Link		
* The aim of this project is to classify news articles fake or real.
* To get the accurately classified collection of news as real or fake I have built a deep learning LSTM based model.  After using many training techniques, I got a validation accuracy of 0.9387% with training accuracy of 0.9538%.
Text To Image Generator, Self, Link
* The aim is to convert a written text (like “a blue flying bird”) into an image. NLP is used to extract a feature vector from the text description. 
* Used GAN to create image from combination of text embedding (1024) and random latent vector (100).
Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network	, Link
* The aim of this project is to build model with which one can generate new images after training the model. I implemented DCGAN architecture from its original paper.  
* During training model was found robust to result on addition of new images to training set.
